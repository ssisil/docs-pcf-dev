This guide describes how to install and use PCF Dev, a lightweight Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) installation that runs on a single virtual machine (VM) on your workstation. PCF Dev is intended for application developers who want to develop and debug their applications locally on a PCF deployment.

PCF Dev includes Pivotal Elastic Runtime, Redis, RabbitMQ, and MySQL. It also supports all Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) functionality. See the [Comparing PCF Dev to Pivotal Cloud Foundry](#comparison-to-pcf) table below for more product details.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites ##

* [VirtualBox: 5.0+](https://www.virtualbox.org/): PCF Dev uses VirtualBox as its virtualizer.
* The latest version of the [cf CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html): Use the cf CLI to push and scale apps.
* You must have an Internet connection for DNS. See <a href="./work-offline.html">Using PCF Dev Offline</a> if you do not have an Internet connection.
* At least 3 GB of available memory on your host machine. Pivotal recommends running on a host system with at least 8 GB of total RAM.
